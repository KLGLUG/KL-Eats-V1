# Food Ordering Website
KL Eats is a innovative platform designed to streamline campus dining for students and faculty. Our mission is to provide a convenient way to pre-order and book meals from various canteens across our campus. This project was developed with the invaluable support of KL GLUG (GNU/Linux User Group), showcasing the power of open-source collaboration in creating practical solutions for our campus community.
