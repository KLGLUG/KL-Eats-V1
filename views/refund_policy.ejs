            <p><strong>VAMSI KRISHNA PASUPUREDDY</strong> believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and has
                therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Immediate Cancellations:</strong> Cancellations will be considered only if the request is
                    made immediately after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be entertained
                    if the orders have been communicated to the vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of
                    shipping them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Perishable Items:</strong> VAMSI KRISHNA PASUPUREDDY does not accept cancellation requests
                    for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, a refund or replacement can be made if
                    the customer establishes that the quality of the product delivered is not good.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Damaged or Defective Items:</strong> In case of receipt of damaged or defective items,
                    please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request will be entertained once the
                    merchant has checked and determined the same. This should be reported within the same day of receipt
                    of the products. If you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your
                    expectations, you must bring it to the notice of our customer service within the same day of
                    receiving the product. The Customer Service Team, after reviewing your complaint, will take an
                    appropriate decision.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Warranty Claims:</strong> In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty
                    from manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. For any refunds approved by <strong>VAMSI
                        KRISHNA PASUPUREDDY</strong>, it will take 6-8 days for the refund to be processed to the end
                    customer.
